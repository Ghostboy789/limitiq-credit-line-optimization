# Deployment

## Local production smoke test

```bash
docker build -t limitiq .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e PORT=8000 limitiq
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

The image runs a non-root user, one Uvicorn worker, no debug mode, capped numeric
threads and a stdlib health check. Training and downloading never occur in the
runtime image.

## Render free web service

1. Push the public repository after tests, secret/privacy/licence checks.
2. In an authenticated Render account, create a Blueprint from `render.yaml`.
3. Confirm plan `free`, Docker runtime, health path `/health`, no secret values,
   and deploy-after-CI-checks behavior.
4. Wait through possible free-tier cold start, then verify `/health`, all seven
   areas, PDF/CSV downloads, sample batch upload, desktop/mobile layout, console
   and logs.

Render free services may spin down and have constrained memory/CPU; see current
official terms: https://render.com/docs/free. This repository uses prebuilt
artifacts and one worker to remain within those constraints.

## Release verification

Do not call a deployment successful until HTTPS, health, model startup,
simulator, account lookup, filtered CSV, PDF, sample CSV and batch output have
been exercised on the public URL and browser/server logs show no material error.
